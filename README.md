A *special* project as a course in UoWM.

Absorbers based on meta surfaces offer efficient solutions to various modern problems and, at the same time, have attractive characteristics (e.g. small thickness). The proposed work is broken down into the following sub-objectives:

- Theoretical study of absorber devices and metamaterials.
	- [ ] Points to Expand
	- [ ] Sources
- Implementation of a specific device at microwave frequencies in simulation software.
- Parametric design and optimization of the device.

The entirety of the study will be compiled and presented to the report.
