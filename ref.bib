	abstract = {Metamaterials ({MM}) are artiﬁcially designed materials that possess unique properties due to their geometrical design. They also display some peculiar properties, such as negative refractive index, Snell’s law reversal, Doppler effect reverse, and left-handed behavior. {MMs} are used in a myriad of applications, including invisibility cloaking, perfect lensing, perfect absorption, and sensing. In this review article, the property of electromagnetic absorption by structures known as metamaterial absorbers ({MMAs}) is discussed. An {MMA} is a composite made up of many layers of metallic patterns separated by dielectric. This novel device helps in achieving near-unity absorption by various mechanisms, which are investigated in this article. The {MMAs} are classiﬁed based on their absorption characteristics, such as polarization tunability, broadband operation, and multiband absorption, in different frequency regimes.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Microwave absorbers have been used to mitigate signal interference, and to shield electromagnetic systems. Two different types of absorbers have been presented: (a) low-cost narrowband absorbers that are simple to manufacture, and (b) expensive wideband microwave absorbers that are based on complex designs. In fact, as designers try to increase the bandwidth of absorbers, they typically increase their complexity with the introduction of several electromagnetic components (e.g., introduction of multi-layer designs, introduction of multiple electromagnetic resonators, etc.,), thereby increasing their fabrication cost. Therefore, it has been a challenge to design wideband absorbers with low cost of fabrication. To address this challenge, we propose a novel design approach that combines origami math with electromagnetics to develop a simple to manufacture ultra-wideband absorber with minimal fabrication and assembly cost. Specifically, we utilize a Tachi–Miura origami pattern in a honeycomb configuration to create the first absorber that can maintain an absorptivity above 90\% in a 24.6:1 bandwidth. To explain the ultra-wideband behavior of our absorber, we develop analytical models based on the transmission-reflection theory of electromagnetic waves through a series of inhomogeneous media. The ultra-wideband performance of our absorber is validated and characterized using simulations and measurements.},

The {EC} model and the proposed topology developed on a low-cost {FR}-4 substrate of thickness 0.048{λL} (λL = wavelength at lower operating frequency) have been analysed for different polarisations and are in close agreement with each other. The structure has also been experimentally verified and good agreement among analytical model, full wave simulation, and the experimental results is observed. The absorber shows the high cost-effective bandwidth ({BWCE} = 81.14) in comparison to many recently reported works which proves its compactness and novelty.},

            In this paper, a broadband metamaterial microwave absorber is designed, simulated and measured. Differently from the traditional method which is only based on unit cell boundary conditions, we carried out full-wave finite integration simulations using full-sized configurations. Starting from an elementary unit cell structure, four kinds of coding metamaterial blocks, 2 × 2, 3 × 3, 4 × 4 and 6 × 6 blocks were optimized and then used as building blocks (meta-block) for the construction of numerous 12 × 12 topologies with a realistic size scale. We found the broadband absorption response in the frequency range 16 {GHz} to 33 {GHz}, in good agreement with the equivalent medium theory prediction and experimental observation. Considering various applications of metamaterials or metamaterial absorbers in the electromagnetic wave processing, including the radars or satellite communications, requires the frequency in the range up to 40 {GHz}. Our study could be useful to guide experimental work. Furthermore, compared to the straightforward approach that represents the metamaterials configurations as 12 × 12 matrices of random binary bits (0 and 1), our new approach achieves significant gains in the broadband absorption. Our method also may be applied to the full-sized structures with arbitrary dimensions, and thus provide a useful tool in the design of metamaterials with specific desired frequency ranges.},

              Flexible microwave absorber ({MAR}), vital in advanced applications such as wearable electronics and precision devices, are highly valued for their lightweight, exceptional electromagnetic waves ({EWs}), and ease of fabrication. However, optimizing the electromagnetic parameters of microwave absorption materials ({MAMs}) to enhance absorption ability and expand effective absorption broadband ({EAB}, reflection loss ({RL}) {\textless}−10 {dB}) is a considerable challenge. Herein, a permittivity‐attenuation evaluation diagram ({PAED}) is constructed using parameter scanning based on the Materials Genome Initiative to determine the ideal electromagnetic parameters and thickness, optimize absorption efficiency, and obtain highly efficient absorbers. Guided by the {PAED}, a multilayer {MAR} consisting of a “matching‐absorption‐reflection layer” and a dielectric loss gradient aligned with the direction of {EWs} propagation is developed. This design significantly enhances the {EWs} penetration and ensures effective absorption, attributed to the well‐matched impedance and attenuation characteristics. As anticipated, the microwave absorption of the absorber (density = 0.063 g cm
              −3
              ) is optimized, with an {RL} of −34 {dB} at
              d
               = 4 mm and an {EAB} covering the entire X‐band (8.2–12.4 {GHz}). This study presents a novel approach for establishing a material database for {MAMs} and developing high‐performance absorbers characterized by thinness, lightness, broad operational frequency range, and robust absorption capacity.},
