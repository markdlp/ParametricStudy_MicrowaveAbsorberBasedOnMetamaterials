\section{\textsf{Theoretical Study}}
    Metamaterials are artificially engineered materials with unique electromagnetic properties
    not found in nature. They are designed with specific geometrical structures that allow them
    to exhibit properties like negative refractive index, reverse Snell's law, and right/left-handed
    behavior. The first to coin the term of metamaterial absorbers was Victor Veselago \cite{veselago_left_2006}.
    
    An MMA typically comprises three layers: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A periodic metallic pattern on top
        \item A dielectric substrate in the middle
        \item A bottom metallic ground plane
    \end{itemize}
    As multi-layer structures in MMAs enable broadband absorption by creating multiple resonant
    frequencies. By stacking different layers with varying properties, a wider range of 
    frequencies can be absorbed effectively.

    Impedance matching is crucial for MMAs to minimize reflection and maximize absorption. 
    This is achieved when the impedance of the MMA is matched to the impedance of free space,
    ensuring that incident electromagnetic waves are absorbed rather than reflected.

    In order to evaluate the absorption of the microwave metamaterial absorber proposed
    in this study \cite{zhang_design_2023} the reflection and transmission power shall be
    calculated as well as the reflection coefficient. The bare necessary equations are
    shown in (\ref{eq:Absorption}).

    \begin{subequations}
        \label{eq:Absorption}
        \begin{align}
            Z & = Z_0 \sqrt{\frac{\mu_r}{\epsilon_r}} \label{eq:Z} \\
            \Gamma & = \frac{Z - Z_0}{Z + Z_0} \label{eq:ReflectionCoeff} \\
            T & = \frac{2Z_0}{Z + Z_0} \label{eq:TransmissionCoeff} \\
            A & = 1 - |\Gamma|^2 - |T|^2 \label{eq:Absorbance}
        \end{align} 
    \end{subequations}

    However the Impedance across the frequency range shall be normalized and in order to be 
    calculated the impedance of each layer shall be factored in but thankfully this is done
    by CST.
